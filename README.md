# Heart-Rate
During this project we will use your computer's webcam to follow the evolution of a pixel on your forehead for a fixed period of time. The vector obtained can then be the object of a Fourier transform in order to make it
frequency analysis. The idea is to analyze the frequencies that appear and see if it is possible to find an approximation of your heart rate.

An other student and me have programmed a code which you can get an approximation of your heart rate and some graphics. In those graphics you can see the evolution of your heart frequency with also the noise frequency because the ambient noise may impair the accurency of the heart rate. As a result, this code is mostly intended for analysing the graphics and take the best heart rate. In order to take the best heart rate, you have to figure out which heart frequency peak is not correlated with the noise frequency.
